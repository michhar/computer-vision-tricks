# Using OpenCV to Mask Based on Color and Calculate Polygons

We can take the following image as input, for example.

<img src="../data/skittles.jpg" width="50%">

In the image results below, only the red candies are found (we intentionally search in a red HSV color space - we could have searched for yellow or both, however) and masked.  The actual polygons are available as well if you look at the `find_polygons_and_masks.py`.

<img src="results/3_polygon_mask.jpg" width="50%">

## Setup

For Python 3, install the required libraries.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running

To find red objects in an image by masking and determining the polygons, run the following python script.

    python find_polygons_and_masks.py --image ../data/skittles.jpg
